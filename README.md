### Hi there 👋

<!--
**niiima/niiima** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

- 👨‍💻 Welcome to my personal Git account repository, @niiima. This is a special repository where you can find my latest updates on my coding journey. 
- 📅 I've been introduced to Programming Languages in 1999 and wrote my first data-centric application with FoxPro when I was only 16 years old. Since then, I've graduated in computer science (software) with a bachelor's degree ten years later. 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on @collaborative-chat-gpt
- 🌱 I’m currently learning open-ai
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI apps
- 💬 Ask me about JavaScript
- 💻 My first dynamic web application was written in 2007 with .NET 2.0/jQuery/SQL. However, these days I prefer to use Next.js/React/MongoDB for my projects. 
- 👨‍💼 If you're interested in my work, feel free to browse through my repository and connect with me for any inquiries. Thank you for stopping by!
